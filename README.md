  <h2>Device-Specific Guidance</h2>
  <h3>iPad and iPhone</h3>
  <p>Access the site through Safari or another supported browser.<br>
  For convenience, use the “Add to Home Screen” option in Safari. This allows the application to behave like a standalone app without browser bars.</p>

  <h3>Android</h3>
  <p>Access through Chrome or another supported browser.<br>
  Use the “Add to Home Screen” feature to install the application as a shortcut.</p>

  <h3>Desktop (Mac or Windows)</h3>
  <p>Access through Safari, Chrome, Firefox, or Edge.<br>
  Users may choose to bookmark the site or, in some browsers, install the application as a standalone web app.</p>

  <h2>Privacy and Disclaimer</h2>
  <h3>Data Storage</h3>
  <p>All chat content, profile pictures, and file attachments are stored in Firebase, a cloud service operated by Google.<br>
  Data is encrypted in storage and in transit, but as with any cloud-based system, absolute security cannot be guaranteed.<br>
  Messages and files may persist in storage unless explicitly deleted by the application or by administrative action.</p>

  <h3>User Responsibility</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Users are responsible for safeguarding their login credentials.</li>
    <li>Choosing a weak password, reusing a password from another service, or sharing credentials with others may result in unauthorized access to the account.</li>
    <li>Users should not share sensitive personal, financial, or legally protected information within the chat application.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Limitations of Liability</h3>
  <p>The developer, Eric Zhu, provides this software “as is” without warranties of any kind.<br>
  The developer is not responsible for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Data loss or corruption.</li>
    <li>Unauthorized account access resulting from poor credential management.</li>
    <li>Malicious behavior or misuse by other users.</li>
    <li>Service interruptions, downtime, or failure to deliver messages or attachments.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Privacy Considerations</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Although Firebase offers industry-standard protections, no platform can ensure absolute confidentiality.</li>
    <li>Users should act under the assumption that messages and attachments are not suitable for highly confidential communication.</li>
    <li>The application does not sell or distribute user data. However, data is subject to Google’s Firebase privacy policies, which users implicitly agree to by using the service.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Legal and Compliance</h3>
  <p>Users must comply with all applicable laws and regulations in their jurisdiction when using this platform.<br>
  Illegal, abusive, or harmful activity is the responsibility of the individual user and not the developer.</p>

  <p>By continuing to use this application, you acknowledge and accept these terms of use, privacy limitations, and disclaimers.</p>
